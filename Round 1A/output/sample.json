      "text": "was incorporated in 1997 as a province-wide library consortium. TAL works collaboratively with its members to promote universal access to materials and resources in more than 250 public, post-secondary, special, government and regional libraries. Unlike ODL, TAL does not include elementary or secondary schools. However, the timeline and funding we are proposing for ODL is comparable to TAL‘s experience. TAL’s business planning took several years. TAL’s implementation plan was supported by 8 million dollars in provincially shared funding, spread over three years, later revised to 15 million dollars over 4 years. Not only is Alberta’s population 30% of Ontario’s, TAL does not include elementary or secondary schools as partners; it has 250 member libraries. ODL envisions universal access for all 10,000,000 Ontarians, with more than 5000 Ontario libraries as partners. Although ODL can learn from TAL’s practices, the scope of planning and implementing ODL is much larger than TAL.",
